# Sample of a local MLOps experimentation workflow built with devcontainer and mlflow

## Dependencies

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (with the "Remote containers" extension installed)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* (Optional) [Devcontainer CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainer-cli) (allows to directly launch devcontainer from commandline, instead of opening VSCode and then clicking on "Reopen in container")

## How to use

1. Clone this repo (or use it as a template for a new one)
2. Open VSCode
3. Either click on "Reopen in container" when the extension detects the devcontainer, or search for it in the command palette (can be opened with `CTRL + SHIFT + P`)
